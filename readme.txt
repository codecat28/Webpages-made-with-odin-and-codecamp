As a part of the Odin Project, I followed Free Code Camp tutorials in learning HTML and CSS.

These webpages are a result of the final assessment. At the end of different course sections, you must 
create a similar copy to what is shown to you using concepts shown in each.

The technical documentation page is an exact copy. 

All of the original designs of each website in the assesments belong to their respective owner(s).
